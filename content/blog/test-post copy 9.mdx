Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Yeah, gimme a Tab. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me.

Ahh. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Well gee, I don't know. Marty, will we ever see you again?

Why do you keep following me around? I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Are you okay? Uh, Doc. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?

A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Good morning, Mom. Right. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Yeah, it's in the back. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Ahh. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.

Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. I think I know exactly what you mean. What? About 30 years, it's a nice round number.

George. George. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Wow, you must be rich. Never mind that now, never mind that now. Who are you?

Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Ahh. Ahh. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

God dammit, I'm late. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Nothing's coming to my mind. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till-
