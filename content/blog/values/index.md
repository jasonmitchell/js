Shared values are an important part of a software development organisations culture; they communicate
how teams prefer to work and their desirable (and undesirable) practices and principles. Many companies
across many industries explicity define and publish their company values to the wider world which can
act as a useful PR tool for recruitment. Some notable examples within the software development industry
are [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/), who actually publish their team handbook as
part of their [transparency](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#transparency) value, and
[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/careers) who more directly use their values as a recruitment tool.

Aligning teams behind a shared set of values is a great way to help define your culture and can help to
make happier teams who are more productive because they understand how to set priorities according to
the values. However getting buy-in can be difficult especially when they are defined by the top of the
organisation and imposed on the teams further down the chain. My experience has been that values defined
in this way are often shallow and meaningless values such as "teamwork" or "take ownership" with little
substance backing them up.

If you want the people on your teams to get behind common values then they need to have a voice in
creating them and you need to elaborate on *why* it is important to your teams. GitLab do a great job
of this with [their values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/); they provide a lot of detail
on the benefits their values bring and even describe how people at different job grades are expected to
demonstrate the values. Personally I would prefer values to have something a bit more brief than this
so there is a balance to be struck here.


I've spent a lot of time thinking about to sort of values I would like to see in a software development
organisation and it got me thinking about what I personally value. This post marks the start of a series
of posts in which I will attempt to define my personal values in software development.
