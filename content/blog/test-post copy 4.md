Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Do you mind if we park for a while? Yeah. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.

Where does he come from? Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Are those my clocks I hear? That's right, he's gonna be mayor.

George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Um, well it's a delorean, right? Ahh. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Hello. Yoo. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay?

Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Yeah.

Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. This is for all you lovers out there. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.

Lorraine. Nothing. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. We never would have fallen in love. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. What's the meaning of this.

Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Well, this is a radiation suit. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984.

Hey boy, are you alright? Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- We never would have fallen in love. What you got under here? Its good.
