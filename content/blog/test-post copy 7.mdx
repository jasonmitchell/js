She's just trying to keep you respectable. Huh? C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? He's alright. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Ahh. Ahh.

We never would have fallen in love. Uh? Your, your right. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. That's him.

Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. George. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars.

This is for all you lovers out there. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?

I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Let him go, Biff, you're drunk.

Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.

Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Why is she gonna get angry with you? I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. No, not yet. Whoa, this is heavy.

Thanks a lot, kid. Working. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Well, they're bigger than me. Uh?

Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. That's for messing up my hair. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.
