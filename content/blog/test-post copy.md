Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Next, please. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.

My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. He's a very strange young man.

Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Right, and where am I gonna be?

I think we need a rematch. Yeah, well history is gonna change. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury.

Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. How about a ride, Mister? Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Well yeah, you know we have two of them.

What, what is it hot? Where the hell are they. Quiet. Looks like a airplane, without wings. Right check, Doc.

Yeah. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Shit. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- We never would have fallen in love.

Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. The hell you doing to my car? What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. That's George McFly.

Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Weight has nothing to do with it. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?

Where? Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Children. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her.
