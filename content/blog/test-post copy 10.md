Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Well, I figured, what the hell. Good morning. Ah. Whoa. Say that again.

That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Working. I, I don't know. Ahh.

Science Fiction Theater. What did you say? Yeah. Oh. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks.

Aw yeah, everything is great. Doc. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Scram, McFly. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance.

Let's go. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Uh, coast guard. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed.

The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Ahh. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun.

Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- What did your mother ever see in that kid? Oh. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.

I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Oh. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Uh, I think so. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car.

Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Mom, is that you? Where were we. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.

My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? I, I don't know. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Are those my clocks I hear? Well, they're bigger than me.
