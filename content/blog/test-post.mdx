Perfect, just perfect. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Okay. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.

Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Yeah, it's 8:00. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand.

Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Doc. Uh, Doc. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Hi, Marty.

Don't tell me anything. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Oh yes sir. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.

What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Looks like a airplane, without wings. That's good advice, Marty.

And he could sleep in my room. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Oh. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?

That's right. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Okay Doc, this is it.

you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. I'm gonna be at the dance. Bet your ass it works. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her.

Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Oh, what I meant to day was- Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too.

I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? I just wanna use the phone. Do you mind if we park for a while? Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike.
