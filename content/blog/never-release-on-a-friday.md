- "Never release on Friday" has been a pretty common thing to hear
- Cont. Deploy. w/ multiple releases per day means we should just take Friday off?
- Does Thursday become the new Friday?
- Modern practices enable us to make Friday releases safe
  - Small releases
  - Continuous integration
  - Automated testing
  - Continuous deployment
  - Fast builds
  - Independent components
  - etc
- We should work to minimise risk in change on any day
  - Sometimes unavoidable to have higher risk changes
- Maybe just don't release last thing on a Friday?
  - Do you have time to release, test, and recover if necessary?
