Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Okay. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Uh, you mean nobody's asked you?

Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Perfect, just perfect. Go. Go. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.

You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. You too. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. What's with the life preserver? I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble.

Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? What? Your, your right. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Ohh, no.

Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Doc. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh.

he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Listen, Doc. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. You're gonna be in the car with her. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him-

The hell you doing to my car? No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Right. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship?

What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. No, Doc. What did I just say? The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue?

Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Ahh.

Calvin. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Uncle Jailbird Joey? You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Hello.
