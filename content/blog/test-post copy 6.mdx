Well, this is a radiation suit. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Go. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.

It's about the future, isn't it? Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Which one's your pop?

That's George McFly? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Yeah, he's right here.

Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Okay, but I don't know what to say. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin?

Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Well, this is a radiation suit. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. What was it, George, bird watching?

Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Go. Go. Go. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. Let's go.

Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Yeah, gimme a Tab.

Don't tell me anything. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. I think I know exactly what you mean.

Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Keys? What the hell is this? Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?

This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? Good morning. Listen, Doc. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Yeah.
