Right about here. What? That's good advice, Marty. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. I, I don't know.

Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Where the hell are they. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? He's a very strange young man.

Marty, will we ever see you again? You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Why not?

Oh, what I meant to day was- Hello, Jennifer. Marty you gotta come back with me. Good morning. Precisely.

Who? George. We all make mistakes in life, children he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Biff.

Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. I don't wanna see you in here again. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Leave me alone.

Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. The storm. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. What did you say? Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

Watch it, Goldie. Doc, you gotta help- Ahh. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.

Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Take care. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Marty, will we ever see you again?

Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. No, why, what's a matter? Lorraine. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. I've gotta go.
