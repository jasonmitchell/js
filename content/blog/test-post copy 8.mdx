I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Hi. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. He's your brother, Mom.

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Huh? Precisely. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?

Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. We do now.

You too. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. I'll get it back to you, alright? Which one's your pop?

Right. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.

Yeah, it's 8:00. What's with the life preserver? Right. I'll get it back to you, alright? Ohh, no.

I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Where does he come from? Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.

Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Yeah.

Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. What? I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug.

You'll find out in thirty years. I have to tell you about the future. Nothing's coming to my mind. Biff. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.
